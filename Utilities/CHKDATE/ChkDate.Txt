
Command: ChkDate.Exe

Syntax: ChkDate <File One> <File Two>

Brief: Sets ErrorLevel on whether one file is newer than another.

Explanation: This function returns an errorlevel 1 if File One is newer than 
File Two. If you don't pass enough parameters, errorlevel 2 is returned. If 
ChkDate can't open one or the other files, it returns an errorlevel of 3.

Example:

     @Echo Off
     ChkDate C:\3Net\3Driver\IDP.Sys G:\Util\Install\3Net\3Driver\IDP.Sys
     If ErrorLevel 3 Goto ByPass
     If ErrorLevel 2 Goto ByPass
     If ErrorLevel 1 Goto CopyFile
     Goto Dos
     :CopyFile
     Copy G:\Util\Install\3Net\3Driver\IDP.Sys C:\3Net\3Driver\IDP.Sys > Nul
     :ByPass
     Echo ERROR: Can't open file or not enough parameters...
     :Dos

Note: This was written because I occasionally get upgrade files. Since I have 
about 150 users on the network, it's a pain to walk to everyone just to copy a 
couple of files. So I wrote this and put it in my MastLog.Bat file.
