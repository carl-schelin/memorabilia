INT 21 - DOS 3.0+ - CANONICALIZE FILENAME OR PATH
	AH = 60h
	DS:SI -> ASCIZ filename or path
	ES:DI -> 128-byte buffer for canonicalized name
Return: CF set on error
	    AX = error code
	        02h invalid component in directory path or drive letter only
	        03h malformed path or invalid drive letter
	    ES:DI buffer unchanged
	CF clear if successful
	    AH = 00h
	    AL = destroyed (00h or 5Ch or last char of current dir on drive)
	    buffer filled with qualified name of form D:\PATH\FILE.EXT or
	      \\MACHINE\PATH\FILE.EXT
Notes:	the input path need not actually exist
	letters are uppercased, forward slashes converted to backslashes,
	  asterisks converted to appropriate number of question marks, and
	  file and directory names are truncated to 8.3 if necessary.
	'.' and '..' in the path are resolved
	filespecs on local drives always start with "d:", those on network
	  drives always start with "\\"
	if path string is on a JOINed drive, the returned name is the one that
	  would be needed if the drive were not JOINed; similarly for a
	  SUBSTed, ASSIGNed, or network drive letter.	Because of this, it is
	  possible to get a qualified name that is not legal under the current
	  combination of SUBSTs, ASSIGNs, JOINs, and network redirections
	functions which take pathnames require canonical paths if invoked via
	  INT 21/AX=5D00h
	this function is used to form the full pathname of an invoked program
	  which is stored after the end of its environment
	supported by OS/2 v1.1 compatibility box
