
Program: Free.Exe version 2.08


Syntax: Free [/d /f /g /h /i /n /r /u /?]


Brief: Displays available and total drive space on all drives.


Switches: 

    /d   - Displays the full text for the drive type. This information is 
           accurate to the best of my knowledge. If you find that something is 
           incorrect, let me know and I'll try to fix it.
    /f   - Checks each floppy in addition to the other drives. May get a 
           "Drive not responding" error. Fixable with the /r switch.
    /g   - Displays the drive usage in a simple text bar graph. It's visually 
           accurate.
    /h/? - Displays quick help text about each switch. The modifiable switches 
           have either a '+' or '-' displayed depending on the permanent 
           setting.
    /i   - Numerical drive usage is displayed along the lines of the /g 
           switch. Also displays sector and cluster sizes.
    /n   - Normally, if a code is unknown ('?'), a four digit hex code is also 
           displayed. If you don't wish to see the code, use this switch to 
           turn it off. You'll still get the '?' for drive type.
    /r   - If a drive would normally return with a "Drive not responding" 
           error, this switch will cause it to be ignored instead.
    /u   - Take the above switches and make them permanent (until next time). 
           If you use this switch to make changes and wish to see one of the 
           other mutually exclusive switch settings, use the modified switches 
           to turn them off. For example, if you have made /g permanent and 
           you wish to see the /d switch instead, you would have to have /d 
           AND /g on the command line. 

*** WARNING *** The /u switch has the capability of being dangerous. I have 
    tried to make sure it doesn't write to anything other than Free.Exe 
    (verifies the location by matching two strings) but you're on your own if 
    you choose to use it. It would be just a little harder to locate a Binary 
    File Editor and make the changes manually or safer yet, don't change it. 
    The default is generally adequate for most situations.
    

Explanation: Free checks each drive from A to Z and displays one of five
    possible lines depending on command line switches:

    1)  d:    available        total   t d:\directory
        [d:]        - is the drive being checked.
        [available] - Free Space.
        [total]     - Total Space.
        [t]         - Drive Type.
                        ' ' for a local, joined or assigned drive.
                        'r' for a removable drive (floppy and bernoulli)
                        'n' for a networked drive.
                        's' for a substituted drive.
                        'v' for a virtual disk (VDisk.Sys).
                        '?' for any other drive. If you see a '?', you will 
                              also see a 4 digit hex code prior to it. This 
                              code is what Free thinks that drive is. If 
                              you'll send me a printout of the code and system 
                              information consisting of drive type, dos 
                              version, system and anything else you think will 
                              identify it, I will try to verify it (maybe by 
                              sending you a copy of the next version to check 
                              for me) and send you the most current version. 
                              The hex code can be turned off by using the /n 
                              switch. 
        [directory] - Current Directory.

    2)  d:    available        total   t uuu%    cccc bytes    sss bytes
        [d:]        - is the drive being checked.
        [available] - Free Space.
        [total]     - Total Space.
        [t]         - Drive Type. (see above)
        [uuu]       - Percentage in use. 
        [cccc]      - Number of bytes per cluster.
        [sss]       - Number of bytes per sector.

    3) ->d<-                              [Network ]Drive not responding.
        [->d<-]     - is the drive being checked.
        [Network ]  - if the drive is a network link and is now unavailable, 
                      you will have this added to the "Drive not responding" 
                      message.

    4) d:    available        total     long drive type
        [d:]              - is the drive being checked.
        [available]       - Free Space.
        [total]           - Total Space.
        [long drive type] - Full text description of device.

    5) d:    available        total    t [ ... ]
        [d:]              - is the drive being checked.
        [available]       - Free Space.
        [total]           - Total Space.
        [ ... ]           - Bar displaying space in use and total space.

Joined and Assigned drives display the same characteristics as the drive 
    they came from. If you Assign to a Network drive, the Assigned drive will 
    be displayed as a Network drive.

I originally decided to make sure it didn't run on any other version of Dos 
    than 3.x but since there have been so many requests for an upgrade, I 
    decided to modify this check. Now it will not work on any version of Dos 
    older than 3.0. If you run it on any Dos other than 3.x, you may produce 
    unpredictable results.

    Unknown code. Forward to Carl

*  Sun's PCNFS doesn't return the same information for each IPL.
** Reports are that the external Bernoulli 8" 20+20 think they are VDISK too.


Note: Since I often move things from one drive to another, I always check to 
    see how much space is left before hand.  I decided to create this utility 
    to fix that and to tell me the current directory.  I like to know what the 
    current directory is so I can copy to E: rather than E:\Advent\NH if E: is 
    already pointing to the correct directory.


After I posted it to comp.binaries.ibm.pc, I received a number of inquiries 
    about some modifications and some hints about how to check for subst'd,
    network'd and so on drive types. 

Plans: Possibly adding a switch later to allow you to show the actual path 
    rather than the substituted or network path.
