    BatchIt is a utility that retrieves a list of directories and builds a
    batch file containing commands to be executed based on each of the
    directories.

    Purpose

    On my LAN, user configuration files are located in their home
    directories. I created a user root directory (D:\USERDIRS) and each
    home directory is based here.

    Until now, I had to create a batch file on the fly or maintain one
    that contained every home directory name when I needed to perform
    maintenance.

    BatchIt creates these batch files as necessary with the required
    commands.

    Syntax

    BatchIt takes two types of parameters: execution method and a list of
    commands to be processed.

    If the execution method parameter is a valid filename then the filename 
    is created and the rest of the parameters are written to this file.

    If the execution method parameter is the word NULL then the rest of
    the parameters are executed directly. This command is easier to run
    but temporary batch files are created for each directory and then
    deleted. You will find it faster to create the batch file and execute
    it seperately.

    The list of commands can be any text you want to execute for each found 
    directory. Because you are executing on multiple directories, I created 
    five replacement codes that can be used. The codes $g, $l, &b and $_ 
    are equivalent to the codes used in the MS-DOS PROMPT command.

        $d - This code is replaced by the found directory name. This is 
             great when you have to execute a command that requires the 
             directory name more than once. Currently you are limited to 
             replicating the directory name fifteen times. This should be 
             more than sufficient. See Example for usage.

        $g - Since you can't pass the greater than character as a
             parameter, I created this code. Output information can be
             stored in a file or passed to NUL if no output is wanted.

        $l - You also can't pass the less than character as a parameter. I
             created this code for the same reason I created $g.
             Information can now be passed into the commands in the new
             batch file.

        $b - This code replaces the pipe character as a parameter.

        $_ - This code breaks the parameter line into multiple lines placed
             in the batch file. Great if you need to do multiple commands.

    Example

    On the LAN I adminstrate, there are over 100 accounts. In each home
    directory are the WIN31, NET, WP51, NTC, and other directories specific 
    to each user. If you needed to get a copy of each user's WIN.INI file 
    you could either go to each directory and copy it to your local drive:

    P:\>copy admin\win31\win.ini c:\win\admin.ini
             1 file(s) copied

    P:\>copy ajackson\win31\win.ini c:\win\ajackson.ini
             1 file(s) copied

    ...

    The standard method, create a batch file on the fly, cutting and 
    pasting until you get all the commands created and then executing the 
    batch file.

    P:\>dir *. > winedit.bat
    P:\>qedit winedit.bat
    <cut and paste, building each line using search and replace>
    P:\>winedit

    You could also maintain a batch file that has a list of each user on
    the LAN. As you add or delete users, you modify this batch file. You
    must periodically check this batch file in case you forgot one time or
    were in a hurry.

    Or you could run BatchIt and create the batch file ready to execute.
    You could even execute the commands without executing a single batch
    file yourself!

    Taking the above situation you would type in the following command:

    P:\>batchit winedit.bat copy $d\win31\win.ini c:\win\$d.ini

    This command would run through the list of directories in the current
    directory, building the batch file WINEDIT.BAT which contain the 
    following lines:

    copy ADMIN\win31\win.ini c:\win\ADMIN.ini
    copy AJACKSON\win31\win.ini c:\win\AJACKSON.ini
    ...

    When you execute WINEDIT.BAT all the files will be copied into your
    C:\WIN directory without you having to do any cutting or pasting. You
    could even execute the command as follows:

    P:\>batchit null copy $d\win31\win.ini c:\win\$d.ini

    This would execute the passed command without the intermediate step of
    executing WINEDIT.BAT! The problem of course would be if there was a 
    problem in the command line. Then you would have to watch every error
    go by without being able to interrupt.

    When using the $_ command you can take the above example and add a new 
    line. This can let you copy and then remove a file.

    P:\>batchit we.bat copy $d\win31\win.ini c:$d.ini$_del $d\win31\win.ini

    This results in the following lines in the batch file WE.BAT

    copy ADMIN\win31\win.ini c:ADMIN.ini
    del ADMIN\win31\win.ini
    copy AJACKSON\win31\win.ini c:AJACKSON.ini
    del AJACKSON\win31\win.ini

    Shareware

    Of course there's always a pitch. I generally write these utilities
    for use on my current LANs. If you want to use it, great. To continue
    to use BatchIt past the two week trial period you must register.

    Good luck and may the farce be with you.

    Release Information

    v1.0    Initial release

    v1.1    Unable to read certain directories on the OS/2 based server. 
            Change the directory verify from the ffblk structure to opening 
            $d\NUL for write access. If I can open this device then ff_name 
            is a directory. Needless to say, you must have write access to 
            the directory to verify existance. Not a problem if you are the 
            ADMIN.

            Add the $_ command to allow multiple lines to be generated for 
            each directory.

            Increase limit of 5 occurances of $d to 15 due to the possible 
            increase of usage of $d due to the addition of $_.

    v1.2    I fixed the "hack" of opening the NUL file by testing the 
            response of accessing the OS/2 directories. The response 
            returns 0x30 which is a combination of FA_DIREC & FA_ARCH. I 
            created FA_OS2DIREC and test for both directory types. Works 
            faster and without flaw.

    v1.21   Help file says "one of the following four commands" when it 
            should say "five"
