
Program: RenFile.Exe version 1.0

Syntax: RenFile [Path]<OldFile> <NewFile> [/s] [/y]

Brief: Renames files (or directories). With switches, you can rename files in 
    a directory structure.

Explanation: Renfile will rename any file (no wildcards just yet) into the 
    second specified file. This is useful when you have to rename files with
    similar names across a directory structure.

    Renfile was written because the name of a virus serial file changed 
    between versions. Since I try to do updates through the LAN logon process, 
    I wrote this up to rename the files. Renfile takes the switches and path
    because I like to write for a broader audience than one particular 
    function. This lets Renfile be used in different circumstances.
