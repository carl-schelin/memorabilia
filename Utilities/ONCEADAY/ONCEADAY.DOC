
Command: OnceADay.Exe

Syntax: OnceADay Verification_FileName

Brief: Returns an ErrorLevel on the match of Today and Verification_FileName's 
    date.

Explanation: OnceADay takes a Filename that you specified on the Command-Line 
    and matches it to today's date. If the date the Filename was last written 
    to is older than today's date, OnceADay returns an ErrorLevel of 1. 

Example:

    @Echo Off
    If "%1"=="" Goto NoParms
    OnceADay %1
    If ErrorLevel 2 Goto NoOpen
    If ErrorLevel 1 Goto NoMatch
    Echo no upgrades or checks...
    Goto Dos
    :NoOpen
    Echo Can't open files
    Goto Dos
    :nomatch
    Echo upgrade in process...
    Goto Dos
    :NoParms
    Echo Forgot the parameters...
    :Dos

Note: I use this program in my MastLog.Bat file to significantly speed up 
    network access to those users that reboot their computers more than once a 
    day. This way, I can execute some programs that only need to be done one 
    time rather than every time they login.
