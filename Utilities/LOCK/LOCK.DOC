
Command: Lock.Exe

Syntax: Lock NumOn | NumOff | CapsOn | CapsOff | AllOn | AllOff

Brief: Toggles Numlock and Capslock from a batch file.

Explanation: Use this program to set the Numlock and Capslock on or off from
   a batch file or the command line. 

Example: (Autoexec.Bat)

     @Echo Off
     Path C:\;C:\Dos; ... 
     Prompt $p$g
     Lock NumOff
     Echo 3+ Workstation Startup Batch file
     Cd\3Net
     Runminds ...
     NetBios
     Minses
     MSReDir
     SetName $$3com$$
     PrtSc
     Logon
     :Abort

Note: I wrote this because I was tired of pressing the Numlock key everytime 
   I booted the computer. I also run a few games that must have the Numlock
   on.
