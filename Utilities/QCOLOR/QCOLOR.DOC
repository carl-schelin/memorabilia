Command: QColor.Exe

Syntax: QColor [S]

Brief: QColor returns an ErrorLevel for the Adapter Type.

Explanation: QColor alone will return an errorlevel from 0 to 11 which 
   shows what kind of adapter you have installed in your machine. If you 
   put any character on the command line (S is an example), it will return
   0, 1, or 2 depending on what kind of monitor.

Note: While I have seen a few programs that return the monitor type, color or
   monochrome, I haven't seen one that shows just what type is installed. Also 
   this returns what it perceives not what is actually there. If you have a 
   clone Herc card, you may see Hercules InColor adapter.
