
Command: IfDir.Exe

Syntax: IfDir [d:]<pathname>

Brief: Check for the Existance of a Drive and Subdirectory.

Explanation: Use IfDir to verify the existance of a path. IfDir returns an 
   ErrorLevel of 2 if you forgot to put the path in, ErrorLevel 1 if the Path 
   does not exist and ErrorLevel 0 if it does exist.

Example:

    @Echo Off
    IfDir %1
    If ErrorLevel 2 Goto NoPath
    If ErrorLevel 1 Goto NoFound
    Goto Found
    :NoPath
    Echo No Path Specified. USAGE: IfDir [D:[Path]]
    Goto Dos
    :NoFound
    Echo Not a valid subdirectory.
    Goto Dos
    :Found
    Echo Found %1!
    Goto Dos
    :Dos

Note: I wrote this because of two things. We have a MastLog.Bat file that all 
   users access. In this file we do two things, check the H:\ space used and 
   write a Stat.Ifo to the Net subdirectory (3n Stat > H:\Net\Stat.Ifo) so we 
   can collect the Ethernet Addresses. IFDir is used to make sure that H:\ is 
   there for NCU and that H:\Net is there for 3N Stat.
