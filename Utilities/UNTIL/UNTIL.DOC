    Until is a utility that pauses and wait for input. The screen saver can be 
    disabled at the prompt. A file 38 characters wide and 9 lines high can be 
    displayed in the center of the screen. Using escape sequences colors can 
    be used to emphasize the message.

    Purpose

    Currently we use many different programs in different ways to pause the 
    network gateways when exiting. Some default to a reboot, others sleep 
    until a designated time.

    The sleep program is what we want to use but there are a couple of 
    deficiencies. It halts so you have to Ctrl+Break to exit the program. 
    There is no way to tell if something is wrong.

    Until is a combination of these utilities. Until uses four parameters to 
    set the time, read in a file and define the screen saver module.

    Syntax

    Until takes five parameters. Three of them are optional. Time is required.

    1) Time. This must be in the hh:mm:ss format including padded numbers. It 
       must be in a 24 hour format as well. For example, 8:23pm would be 
       20:23:00. Until checks the passed time against this format. If you do 
       not pass it correctly, Until will not automatically exit.

    2) Filename. This must have an extension. Pass the parameter as 
       filename.ext. The path can be included. You can have a central area for 
       multiple applications.

    3) NoSleep. This disables the screen saver funtion. This would be used in 
       case of an error. You pass an error file and then turn off the screen 
       saver. Whomever is watching the systems will notice the obvious 
       problem.

    4) Novell. This changes the screen saver activity prompt to the normal 
       Novell activity prompt. 

    5) Short. This reduces the screen saver start time from 30 seconds to 5 
       seconds. 

    The parameters can be passed in any order and case is not sensitive. The 
    only restrictions are in the Time format, must be in 24 hour format with 
    hh:mm:ss padded with zeros and the Filename parameter which requires an 
    extension (or at least the trailing dot).

    On Exit

    When Until exits, an errorlevel code is also returned. If you don't pass 
    the exit time (a required parameter) Until with exit with an errorlevel of 
    2. If Until completes at the proper time -or- you press any key other than 
    <Esc>, Until will return an errorlevel of 0. If you press <Esc>, an 
    errorlevel of 1 is returned. This lets you trap for a halt of the batch 
    file and seamlessly exit the batch file without the "Admin Stomp" of 
    pressing <Ctrl><Break> until the batch file stops.

    Special

    This was written using the TeSseRact C eXtended Library (TCXL). It is a 
    library of windowing and data entry routines. As a result, the text file 
    can use some escape characters to create a colorful text message (see the 
    example file: ERROR.TXT).

    The following escape codes can be used:

    Escape Code  Function
    -----------  --------
        +        Increase text attribute
        -        Decrease text attribute
        Ax       Set text attribute to (x)
        Fx       Set foreground text attribute to (x)
        Bx       Set background text attribute to (x)
        I        Toggle intensity
        L        Toggle blink
        X        Reverse text attribute
        Rx       Set window row coordinate to (x)
        Cx       Set window column coordinate to (x)
        Ex       Erase (x) where (x) is one of the following:
          W      Entire window, home cursor
          L      To end-of-line
          S      To end-of-window
        Dxy      Display (x) character (y) times
    
    You must pass <Esc>+<Esc>-. You cannot pass <Esc>+-.

    The coordinate codes must follow the window itself. 38 columns wide and 9 
    rows deep.
    
    The foreground attributes are:

    @ - Black   D - Red        H - Dk. Grey    L - Lt. Red
    A - Blue    E - Magenta    I - Lt. Blue    M - Lt. Magenta
    B - Green   F - Brown      J - Lt. Green   N - Yellow
    C - Cyan    G - Lt. Grey   K - Lt. Cyan    O - White
    
    The background attributes are: 

      0 to  15 - Black         64 to  79 - Red     
     16 to  31 - Blue          80 to  95 - Magenta 
     32 to  47 - Green         96 to 111 - Brown   
     48 to  63 - Cyan         112 to 127 - Lt. Grey

    To use the <Esc>Ax escape sequence, use the foreground attributes in 
    numerical order with Black being 0. Add them to the background color you 
    want to use and that's the character you need to use to create the 
    combined color for that sequence.

    For example, to put a file with the foreground color of white and a 
    background of red you would add 15 (White) to 64 (the start of the red 
    background) and get 79 (64 + 15). Then, in the text file, using the <Alt> 
    key and the keypad, enter <Esc> (<Alt>27), <A>, and <79>(Alt>79) to come 
    up with <Esc>AO.

    You are limited to 255 characters per line in the file.

    Example

    If the current time is 8pm and you want Until to restart the batch file at 
    4am. You want to pass a standard message file but you do want the screen 
    saver to kick in you would pass:

    C:\>until 04:00:00 message.txt

    Until will start, display the time Until will exit at and the current 
    time. Within 30 seconds, the screen saver will kick in. At 4am, Until will 
    exit and the batch file will continue.

    Shareware

    Of course there's always a pitch. I generally write these utilities
    for use on my current LANs. If you want to use it, great. To continue
    to use BatchIt past the two week trial period you must register.

    Good luck and may the farce be with you.
