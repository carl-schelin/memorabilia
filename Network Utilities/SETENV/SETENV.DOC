
Command: SetEnv.Exe

Syntax: SetEnv [{N}ame | {A}ddress | {V}ideo] Environment_Name 
               | Size Minimum_Environment_Size

Brief: Sets the master environment for a user's login name, ethernet address, 
video adapter type, or return an errorlevel if the environment is smaller than 
a number you set.

Description: SetEnv is actually four functions. 
   1) SetEnv Name Env_Name - allows you to assign a user's login name to an 
         environment variable you set.
   2) SetEnv Address Env_Name - allows you to assign a user's ethernet address 
         to any environment variable.
   3) SetEnv Video Env_Name - allows you to assign A, D or E depending on your 
         video board. The A, D or E corresponds with the 3Com 3+Menus default 
         colors. A is monochrome, E is color and D is used for systems that 
         use both. I have A for straight monochrome, D for any graphics 
         adapter that runs in monochrome mode and E for any color system.
   4) SetEnv Size Min_Env_Size - this allows you to return an errorlevel based 
         on the size of your environment. If your environment is less than 
         Min_Env_Size, then errorlevel 1 is returned. 

Example:

     @Echo Off
     SetEnv Size 1024
     If ErrorLevel 1 Goto ByPass
     SetEnv Name S_User
     SetEnv Address S_Station
     SetEnv Video S_DType
     Set S_FileDir=H:\Net\
     Set S_Server=%Department%:HQ:GTSI
     Set S_Usermenu=%Department%
     :ByPass

Note: On my network, we are using Saber menus which require some environment 
parameters. It uses S_User, S_Station and S_Server for the Meter program for 
logging in to an application. I found the Environment manipulation source code 
on a bulletin board, the 3Com 3+Developers Library and CXL for the video 
routine.
