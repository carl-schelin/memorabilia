
Command: Admin.Exe

Syntax: Admin [Domain_Name]

Brief: Admin displays all users on the 3+Share Network that have the 
    Capability Class of Admin. 

Explanation: Admin loops through the entire Name Service (NS_DOM.xxx) looking 
    for any user that has the Capability Class of Admin.
You can select a single domain by specifying the domain name on the 
    Command-Line. The Domain_Name option assumes only the default 
    Organization. 
This program will only operate if you are logged in and have the Capability 
    Class of Admin.

Example:

Getting ADMIN users from the Name Service...

Organization Selected: GTSI
    Domain Selected: HQ
        ADMIN: [admin:HQ:GTSI]
    Domain Selected: Chantilly
    Domain Selected: Dallas
        ADMIN: [admin:HQ:GTSI]
Organization Selected: 3Com
    Domain Selected: VA


Note: I wrote this program mainly because of security. I wanted to know who 
    was an ADMIN on the 3+Share Network that I was Administering.
This version, 1.1, reflects the search through every Organization rather than 
    just the default one.
