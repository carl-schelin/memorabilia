
Command: ChkMail.Exe

Syntax: ChkMail

Brief: Tells you whether you have mail and returns an errorlevel.

Explanation: Use ChkMail to determine whether you have mail on a 3+Share 
network. If you have mail, you will see a message and an errorlevel 1 will be 
returned. If you do not have mail, errorlevel 0 will be returned. If there is 
any error, an errorlevel of 2 is returned. I used the 3+Developers Library 
function D3LCheckForMail to determine whether you have mail.

Example:

     @Echo Off
     ChkMail
     If ErrorLevel 2 Goto Dos
     If ErrorLevel 1 Goto MailCall
     Goto Dos
     :MailCall
     Echo Loading 3+Mail...
     H:
     Cd\MailBox
     G:\Mail\Mail H:\MailBox /DisplayType=E
     Goto NoMail
     :Dos

Note: I wrote this to do two things. In the menu system I use, I can assign a 
program to a function key. I assigned ChkMail to F4. If there is mail, I go 
into mail, otherwise I return to menus. I can also check for mail before 
loading menus and send the user right in.
