
Command: Convert.Exe

Syntax: Convert [User | Admin | Server | Default]

Brief: Convert modifies or displays your Capability Class.

Explanation: Convert allows any 3+Share user the ability to modify their 
Capability Class to any of the available User Types.  Typing Default will 
revert you to your actual Capability Class.  I extract it from the Name 
Service to get the correct one.  

3+Share stores your user information in the Login Library which is located in 
your PC's memory.  This information consists of your Three-part Username, Mail 
Server name, Share Server name and Capability Class.  Your Capability Class 
can be one of three settings: User (02), Admin (03) or Server (04).  This 
information is stored in the 15xx:0000 to 20xx:0000 range.  

Convert searches memory from 0000:0000 to 7D00:0010 (0 to 32,000 bytes) until 
it finds the Domain<NULL>Organization<NULL>Login Name<NULL> pattern.  The 
third byte past the last NULL should be a 02, 03, or 04.  The first and second 
byte pass NULL is your encrypted password.  Convert then modifies it to 
reflect the setting you requested.

I wrote this program for two reasons.  The first one was to see if it could be 
done.  Being a curious sort, I had heard that there was a way to modify a user 
to allow anyone to be an Admin.  Second, I have this thing about security.  I 
modify my password to the Network every 3 or 4 months and modify the network 
passwords every 3 months.  Since anyone could make themselves an Admin, 
security is basically shot.

Note: For those who are as security conscious as I, anyone can login as the 
server and create and delete any sharename.  The user is changed to an 
admin, adds a user to the network with the same number of characters as the 
server, logs in as the user, makes him a server, debugs memory to change the 
username to the servername and now can add any sharename he wishes.  If you 
are using 1.3.1 share or later, you can create a sharename to a root 
directory.  

If you are using 3+Route and have the phone number and network number, you can 
send a message to anyone on that network.  Watch the packets coming in from 
the Route server using a packet watch program.  When you see an address come 
in, make a note of it.  Create a server in their domain and org.  Login as the 
server user for that server.  Create a directory on the remote server pointing 
to the 3Plus directory (or any other one).  Link to the directory and you're 
on your way.  It'll be a little slow, but accessible.  

Fixes: The only thing that I can think of to stop a majority of this from 
happening is to make your ShrList read-only.  Then someone couldn't create or 
delete sharenames.  You can do the same thing with the NS_DOM.xxx files.  Then 
a new user couldn't be added or modified.  The problem with this fix is that 
the server will not boot if the ShrList has been protected.  Then you will 
have to modify your 3Plus_On.Bat file to unprotect the ShrList file.  This 
worked fine until I tried it on a 3Server3.  Even with it unprotecting it, the 
server wouldn't boot.  I had to reboot twice for it to work.  Also, user's 
will not be able to create personal ShareNames and they will not be able to 
modify their passwords.
