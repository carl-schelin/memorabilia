
Command: Alias.Exe

Syntax: Alias [&] [Domain_Name]

Brief: Alias displays all Aliases and their matching Name Service names. 

Explanation: Alias loops through the Name Service reading an Alias and 
    displaying the Username that matches it. If it can't find a Username, an 
    error is displayed instead.
You can use the "&" Command-Line option to display only the undefined 
    Usernames. 
If you specify a Domain_Name, Alias will only search it. You may also specify 
    the "&" option to get only the undefined Usernames located in the domain 
    you choose.

Note: This program was written to test some routines for a larger program. I 
    decided to refine it a bit and send it out. I hope you like it.
