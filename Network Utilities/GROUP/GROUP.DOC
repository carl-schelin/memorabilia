
Command: Group.Exe

Syntax: Group [Domain_Name]

Brief: Group verifys every member of a Group to make sure the member is a 
    valid Username.

Explanation: Group loops through the Name Service reading each group and then 
    verifying every member. If a member is discovered that doesn't belong to 
    the Wide-Area-Network, it is displayed.
You can also select just one domain by entering it on the Command-Line when 
    you execute Group.

Example: 

GROUP Name Verifier v1.1, Copyright (C) 1990, by Carl Schelin
Getting Members from the Name Service...
ERROR: "Schelin_Carl:NYMA:GTSI" in "HQ:HQ:GTSI" is an invalid Username.

Note: This program was written to test some routines for a larger program. I 
    decided to refine it a bit and send it out. I hope you like it.
